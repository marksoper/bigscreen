BigScreen creates a full-sized photo slideshow.

It's meant to display a photographer's latest or favorite shots in a high-quality gallery setting as soon as this content has been uploaded to the photo sharing site of his or her choice.

How BigScreen differs from other javascript slideshows:

1. It sources images directly from various photo service APIs.  This means that with little or no backend, your show can tap into a rich set of current content.  Initially Flickr's REST API is built in - just supply your own parameters and you're good to go.  Other APIs, like Facebook, can be added in a modular way using the PhotoLoader class.

2. It's designed to maximize the viewing area of the window or div it resides in by combining the available photos into good-looking "screens".  The Screen class represents the unit of display in the slideshow rather than an individual photo.  E.g. two portrait images could be combined side-by-side to fill a landscape-sized window.
